SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLES.

class Product {
    String name;
    String category;
    int price;

    public Product(String name, String color, int price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.category = category;
        this.price = price;
    }
}

The above code defines a simple Product class having three instance variables – name, category and price.
class Invoice {
    private Product product;
    private int quantity;

    public Invoice(Product product, int quantity) {
        this.product = product;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    public int calculateTotal()  {
        return product.price * this.quantity;
    }

    public void printInvoice() {

System.out.println("Printing invoice: " + invoice.toString());


    }

    public void saveToDb() {

    }
}

//The above Invoice class violates the SRP because it has multiple
responsibilities – it is responsible for calculating the total amount, printing the invoice, and saving the invoice to the database. As a result, if the calculation logic changes, such as the addition
of taxes, the calculateTotal() method would require modification
